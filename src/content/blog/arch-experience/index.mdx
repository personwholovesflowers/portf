<Callout variant="note">
this was the worst experience of me using arch

so if u wanna install it, u need to have brain, and u need to be smart, very smart

</Callout>
  
after i broked linux mint, i was interested to install arch, cuz all my previous times, when i installed arch, it was broken on nvidia drivers installation.

i found some 20 min youtube tutorial from indian man.

i followed all steps, installed gnome, and after rebooting, black screen.

i had blackscreen after installing arch like 3 or 4 times, and all this times, i ended ragequitting.

this time, i was ready for it.

<Callout title='by chatgpt' variant="solution">
chatgpt said that i didnt configure mkinitcpio

fix:

```sh
sudo pacman -S nvidia nvidia-utils nvidia-settings
sudo mkinitcpio -P
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

this 3 lines of cmd prompt, fixed all problems.

and i first time installed nvidia drivers on arch correct way.

</Callout>

after complete intall of arch, i started make thinks.

all was okay - **UNTIL** i installed steam.

first of all, steam didnt wanted to see my ssd's.

steam appears to be seeing hard drives ONLY if drives had system mount points.

somehow, i fixed it, and **ANOTHER** problem appeared.

if i wanna run game, that doesnt nativly supports linux through proton, it didnt even started.

i tried to fix it, by running it through [gnome "Bottles"](https://github.com/bottlesdevs/Bottles), [heroic launcher](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/), nothing.

and after many **DAYS**, of trying and fixing, i simply deleted arch.

i was really tired of doing this shit.

<Callout variant="tip">
  dont dualboot arch, if u have all games downloaded on windows.
</Callout>

next time i'll try to install nixos.
